Financial Document Analyzer – Debug Fix & Production Upgrade
📌 Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered Financial Document Analyzer built using CrewAI and FastAPI.

The original codebase contained multiple logical, architectural, and safety issues.
This submission fixes all bugs and upgrades the system into a production-ready AI microservice.

Enhancements include:

Fixed CrewAI integration bugs

Safe, evidence-based financial analysis prompts

Redis + Celery queue worker for concurrent request handling

SQLite database integration for storing results

Structured API architecture

🐛 Bugs Identified & Fixes
1️⃣ Undefined LLM Initialization

Issue:

llm = llm

This caused runtime failure.

Fix:
Properly initialized CrewAI LLM using environment variable:

llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)

2️⃣ Incorrect Tool Usage

Issue:
tool=[...] used instead of tools=[...]

Fix:
Replaced with correct CrewAI tool initialization and implemented BaseTool subclass.


3️⃣ PDF Loader Not Imported

Issue:
Pdf(file_path=path).load() was undefined.

Fix:
Replaced with PyPDFLoader from langchain-community.


4️⃣ File Path Not Passed to Crew

Issue:
Uploaded file path was never passed to the CrewAI task.

Fix:
Updated kickoff() call to include:

{
  "query": query,
  "file_path": file_path
}


5️⃣ Unsafe & Hallucination-Based Prompts

Issue:
Agents were instructed to:

Fabricate financial advice

Generate fake URLs

Ignore document content

Provide non-compliant recommendations

Fix:
Rewrote prompts to:

Enforce evidence-based analysis

Prevent hallucination

Restrict analysis strictly to document content

Provide structured financial reporting

6️⃣ Blocking API Execution

Issue:
Long-running AI tasks blocked FastAPI requests.

Fix:
Implemented Redis + Celery queue worker for asynchronous processing.

7️⃣ No Persistence Layer

Issue:
Analysis results were not stored.

Fix:
Added SQLite database using SQLAlchemy to store:

Filename

User query

AI-generated analysis

Timestamp

8️⃣ Missing Dependencies

Added required packages:

langchain-community

pypdf

sqlalchemy

celery

redis

python-dotenv

uvicorn
